 # Data-Scraping-with-Selenium-and-Dynamic-Filtering-using-Streamlit
 
 ## INTRODUCTION
* The 'Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application' is designed to improve the transportation industry by offering an easy way to collect, analyze, and visualize bus travel data.
  By using Selenium, the project automatically gathers detailed information from Redbus, such as bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. This makes data collection easier and provides useful tools for making better decisions, helping to boost efficiency and planning in the transportation sector.

## FEATURES OF APPLICATION

## Retrive the Bus Information:
      Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers, which is especially useful for web scraping tasks. If you want to retrieve bus details from RedBus, 
     you can use Selenium to automate the process of searching for buses and extracting the relevant information. This involves interacting with web elements 
     like input fields and buttons, waiting for the page to load, and extracting the desired details from the search results.

## Store data in database:
   * After collecting bus details, the data is organized into pandas dataframes. We then create a new database and tables using the MySQL connector. The data is stored in these tables, and the database can be easily accessed and managed within the MySQL environment.

## web app - streamlit:
   * With the help of Streamlit, you can create an interactive application similar to RedBus by designing a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for bus routes, view available buses, and get details like departure times and prices.

## PACKAGES AND LIBRARIES
